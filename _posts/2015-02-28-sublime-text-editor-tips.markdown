Why sublime?
===================================

Recently I've got in touch with this amazing text editor, and I've only coded with it since then. It's named [Sublime][sublime] and I am really enjoying the editor. I am sure that I have been coding faster by using it. I'll show why I find it so nice. You can download it [here][download]. It has a lot of good syntax highligthers for 40+ languages and some great tools.

Functionalities and hotkeys 
===================================

* Duplicate current line : ctrl+shift+d 
* Swap lines : ctrl+shift+<up,down>(where you want the line to go).
* Multiple selections : ctrl+d

* Spliting screen : alt+shift+ number_of_splits( how many divisions you want)

* Enable distraction free mode : shift+F11
* Search on current paste : ctrl+shift+f (you can actually use regex as well which makes it really nice and gives you options to do things like replacing!!)

* Open a file : ctrl+ p + <file_name>

What else can you do
===================================

* Open multiple project folders simultianeously.
* Easily customise your Sublime with JSON configuration files.
* Run code directly from it (ctrl+shift+b), you need to configure it to run the language of choice.
* Use plugins where you can find a lot of extra functionalities, one example is a github plugin which shows you what lines are different from the ones in the repository.

Conclusion
==========
I could see my evolution to a more agile programming with these commands and the very clean interface sublime offers. I hope you can use some of the things from Sublime that can make your coding faster :))
