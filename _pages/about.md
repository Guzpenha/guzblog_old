I am a PhD candidate at TU Delft on the topic of  conversational search under the supervision of [Claudia Hauff](https://chauff.github.io/){:target="_blank"}. Before joining the PhD, I worked with machine learning and data science projects for 3 years at [Hekima](http://www.hekima.com/){:target="_blank"}.

<!-- I have BSc and MSc degrees from the Department of Computer Science (DCC) of UFMG - under the supervision of [Rodrygo Santos](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~rodrygo/){:target="_blank"} -->

My research is currently focused on neural rankers for information-seeking conversations. We created a novel dialogue corpus of information-seeking conversations which has a few properties previous datasets lack: [MANtIS](https://guzpenha.github.io/MANtIS/){:target="_blank"}. We studied how neural rankers for dialogue perform on unseen domains, and how to improve then in the [domain adaptation](https://guzpenha.github.io/guzblog/assets/pdf/Domain_Adaptation_for_CRR_CAIR20.pdf){:target="_blank"} setup. We also showed that by intelligently sorting the training batches we get more effective neural rankers: [curriculum learning for IR](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08555){:target="_blank"}.  In our latest [work](https://guzpenha.github.io/guzblog/assets/pdf/Challenges_CONVERSE20.pdf){:target="_blank"} we reflect on the challenges of current offline evaluation schemes for conversational search tasks.

 I am currently developing a library that facilitates experiments with pre-trained transformers, e.g. BERT, for ranking: [**transformer-rankers**](https://guzpenha.github.io/transformer_rankers/){:target="_blank"}. It can be used to quickly train and evaluate a transformer-based model for different ranking tasks, such as passage retrieval, adhoc retrieval, conversation response ranking, etc.

<!-- Before joining the PhD, my research was focused on performance prediction, i.e. predicting the effectiveness of models, for recommendation, document classification and adhoc retrieval ([ECIR'19](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~rodrygo/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/penha2019ecir.pdf), [Master thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ScGA8EASeQbJvOLXJTBY77_zJNF0kspx/view)). As an undergrad I did research on scientific collaboration networks ([JCBS](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2Fs13173-017-0059-6.pdf), [Scientometrics](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11192-016-1901-x])). -->
