I am a PhD student at TU Delft doing research on **conversational search** under the supervision of [Claudia Hauff](https://chauff.github.io/){:target="_blank"}. I have BSc and MSc degrees from the Department of Computer Science (DCC) of UFMG - under the supervision of [Rodrygo Santos](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~rodrygo/){:target="_blank"}. Before joining the PhD, I worked with machine learning and data science projects for 3 years at [Hekima](http://www.hekima.com/){:target="_blank"}.


Recently, my research has focused on models for information-seeking conversations. We created a novel [dialogue corpus](https://guzpenha.github.io/MANtIS/){:target="_blank"} of information-seeking conversations which has a few properties previous datasets lack. We also developed and studied neural rankers inspired by techniques such as [domain adaptation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dj1MvtFju3RHako7l-avoXQsCT-6vc8V/view){:target="_blank"}, [curriculum learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08555){:target="_blank"} and [slice-based learning](https://www.snorkel.org/blog/slicing){:target="_blank"}.

Before joining the PhD, my research was focused on performance prediction, i.e. predicting the effectiveness of models, for recommendation, document classification and adhoc retrieval ([ECIR'19](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~rodrygo/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/penha2019ecir.pdf), [Master thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ScGA8EASeQbJvOLXJTBY77_zJNF0kspx/view)). When I was an undergrad I did research on scientific collaboration networks ([JCBS](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2Fs13173-017-0059-6.pdf), [Scientometrics](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11192-016-1901-x])).
