I am a PhD student at TU Delft doing research on **conversational search** under the supervision of [Claudia Hauff](https://chauff.github.io/){:target="_blank"}. I have BSc and MSc degrees from the Department of Computer Science (DCC) of UFMG - under the supervision of [Rodrygo Santos](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~rodrygo/){:target="_blank"}. Before joining the PhD, I worked with machine learning and data science projects for 3 years at [Hekima](http://www.hekima.com/en/){:target="_blank"}.


In the first year of my PhD I investigated neural ranking models for the conversation response ranking task. In particular models for information-seeking conversations: we created a novel dialogue corpus (MANtIS) of information-seeking conversations which has a few properties previous datasets lack. I developed and studied neural rankers inspired by techniques such as domain adaptation, curriculum learning and slice-based learning.

Before joining the PhD, my research was focused on performance prediction, i.e. predicting the effectiveness of models, for recommendation, document classification and adhoc retrieval ([ECIR'19](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~rodrygo/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/penha2019ecir.pdf), [Master thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ScGA8EASeQbJvOLXJTBY77_zJNF0kspx/view)). When I was an undergrad I did research on scientific collaboration networks ([JCBS](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2Fs13173-017-0059-6.pdf), [Scientometrics](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11192-016-1901-x])).
