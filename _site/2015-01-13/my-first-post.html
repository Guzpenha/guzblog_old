  <p>Hello! My name is Gustavo Penha, and this is the first post of my blog. I am a computer scientist currently studying at <a href="https://www.ufmg.br/">UFMG</a> who wants to graduate by 2016 :). I am doing this blog as sort of an experiment. I’ll post about things such as open-source contributions - which I intend to do this year - and other works from college as well as from scientific initiation that I been doing for about a month.</p>

<p>Moving from myself to another subject, this site is being served by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jeskyll</a>, which I got to know because of github’s trending open-source projects page. I will be completely honest and say that I gave it a try mostly because it’s a project written in ruby, and I’ve been drawed to this programming language since I’ve got the opportunity to use it.</p>

<p>It was incredibly painless to start my blog using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jeskyll</a> and I believe I will keep using it for the near future. I still have to learn more about <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">Markdown</a>, which is the way I am styling this text right now. Overall they both seems pretty nice.</p>

<p>What took me the most effort was publishing it in Github pages, I was constantly getting the error below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The page build failed with the following error:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The file <code class="highlighter-rouge">my-site/css/main.scss</code> contains syntax errors</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After some time searching for errors in this file and in github and stackoverflow threads, I realized on this <a href="http://www.egeersoz.com/jekyll/update/2014/09/06/using-jekyll-and-github-pages-for-blogging.html">blog</a> by @egeersoz that my error was using another folder for my blog inside my repository. After moving everything to the root of the repository it started working fine.</p>

<p>To wrap up this post and start this blog I will make a short list of what I expect to be focusing on this blog:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Computer Science</li>
  <li>Code</li>
  <li>Programming</li>
  <li>Open-source</li>
  <li>Articles</li>
  <li>Tutorials</li>
</ul>

<p>I think that’s all for my first post guys, cya.</p>
